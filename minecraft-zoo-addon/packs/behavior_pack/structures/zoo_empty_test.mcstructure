# This is a placeholder for the actual .mcstructure file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary structure file created in Minecraft
# using structure blocks, but for now we'll create a minimal setup.
#
# To create proper test structures:
# 1. In Minecraft, use /give @s structure_block
# 2. Place the structure block
# 3. Set it to "Save" mode
# 4. Define a 3x3x3 empty area
# 5. Name it "zoo:empty_test"
# 6. Save the structure
#
# This creates the .mcstructure file that GameTests will use as a test environment.
