### Implementation Roadmap Based on Resources

#### ✅ Already Implemented (Following Best Practices)
- Docker containerization using itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
- Proper behavior pack structure
- Environment variable configuration
- Docker Compose setup

#### 🔄 Next Steps (Based on Resources)
1. **GameTest Framework Integration**
   - Add GameTest scripts to minecraft-zoo-addon
   - Create `.mcstructure` files for test environments
   - Implement JavaScript test functions
   - Update manifest.json for GameTest dependencies

2. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
   - Enhance `test-addon.sh` with GameTest commands
   - Add structure validation
   - Implement CI/CD testing workflows

3. **Server Management**
   - Use itzg container's advanced features
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Add backup and recovery procedures

## 🎯 Quick Action Items from Resources

### For Getting Server Running with Tests
1. **Enable Beta APIs**: Ensure experimental features are enabled in server
2. **Add GameTest Dependencies**: Update behavior pack manifest
3. **Create Test Structures**: Use structure blocks to create test environments
4. **Write Test Scripts**: Implement JavaScript GameTest functions
5. **Run Tests**: Use `/gametest` commands to validate functionality

### For Production Deployment
1. **Follow itzg Documentation**: Use their production deployment guides
2. **Implement Monitoring**: Use container health checks and logging
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement world and configuration backups
4. **Security**: Follow container security best practices
