I need help setting stuff up

here are some guides I was told would be good. Not sure how true it is, but what are your thoguhts?

üñ•Ô∏è Best Workflow for Bedrock Addon Development & Testing

1. Local Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS)
	‚Ä¢	Why: Lets you instantly test and debug behavior packs/add-ons without needing to upload to your iPad or Switch every time.
	‚Ä¢	What: Mojang‚Äôs official Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS) runs on Windows, Linux, or even in Docker.
	‚Ä¢	How it helps: You just drop your world and add-on files in the right folders, start the server, and instantly see results (and error messages/logs!).

‚∏ª

2. Coolify + Docker: Running BDS
	‚Ä¢	Coolify is a modern self-host platform‚Äîperfect for running containerized workloads like Minecraft servers.
	‚Ä¢	There are community Docker images for BDS, so you can deploy a Bedrock server to Coolify and expose it for LAN/remote testing.

Recommended Docker Images for Bedrock
	‚Ä¢	itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server
	‚Ä¢	Most popular, regularly updated, great docs.
	‚Ä¢	Supports custom worlds, auto-backup, and easy add-on/behavior pack installation.
	‚Ä¢	Docker Hub page
	‚Ä¢	mc-bds/docker-bedrock-server
	‚Ä¢	Another good option, with environment variable controls.

How to use with Coolify:
	‚Ä¢	Add a new ‚ÄúDocker Compose‚Äù app in Coolify.
	‚Ä¢	Use the Compose or single-container settings to spin up the Bedrock server image.
	‚Ä¢	Mount a volume for your worlds and behavior_packs/resource_packs so you can update without rebuilding.
	‚Ä¢	You can SFTP or use Coolify‚Äôs file manager to upload your custom behavior pack files as you iterate.

‚∏ª

3. Debugging & Hot Reload
	‚Ä¢	BDS will print errors and warnings if there are problems with your packs‚Äîmuch easier than cryptic iPad errors!
	‚Ä¢	You can restart the server in seconds after making a change.
	‚Ä¢	Join your server from your iPad/Switch/PC to test live multiplayer behaviors.

‚∏ª

4. Optional: Code Testing
	‚Ä¢	GameTest Framework: Use the GameTest scripting in your behavior packs for automated scenario testing.
	‚Ä¢	Bedrock Preview/Beta: You can run the Preview build of BDS to get the latest Script API support if you want bleeding-edge features.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Quick-Start Plan
	1.	Set up a Docker Bedrock server (e.g. itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server) on your Coolify instance.
	2.	Mount/Expose the folders for:
	‚Ä¢	/data/worlds (your actual world)
	‚Ä¢	/data/behavior_packs (drop your scripts here)
	‚Ä¢	/data/resource_packs
	3.	Develop and edit your code locally (on your laptop/desktop).
	4.	Upload changes to the server‚Äôs behavior_packs folder (Coolify file manager or SFTP).
	5.	Restart the server (from Coolify or command line).
	6.	Join with Minecraft on any Bedrock device to test‚Äîfast feedback and logs.

‚∏ª

üóÇÔ∏è Repos/Tools for Addon Code Testing (Outside Minecraft App)
	‚Ä¢	bedrock-addon-tools: CLI tools to lint and validate your Bedrock packs before uploading.
	‚Ä¢	bridge.: Visual editor for Bedrock add-ons. Lets you simulate/test logic before even running Minecraft.
	‚Ä¢	Blockbench: 3D model editor, good for entity work.

‚∏ª

Summary Table

Need	Solution/Repo
Run BDS server easily	itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server
Deploy/host on Coolify	Add as Docker app or Compose in Coolify
Update/add test code fast	Upload to behavior_packs on the server
See errors/fix fast	Watch server logs in Coolify or via SSH
Edit/test add-ons visually	bridge., Blockbench, bedrock-addon-tools





ü¶Å Minecraft Bedrock Addon Framework for a Customizable Zoo World

Goal:
Make a ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù for your interactive zoo using open-source code and frameworks.
You‚Äôll be able to:
	‚Ä¢	Add AI-powered NPCs (visitors, staff, guides)
	‚Ä¢	Create custom commands, interactive objects, and features
	‚Ä¢	Control permissions (who can do what)
	‚Ä¢	Easily expand or customize everything‚Äîno world limitations

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ Foundation: Blokkr or Microsoft Scripting Samples
	‚Ä¢	Pick your starting point:
	‚Ä¢	Blokkr (for project structure, easy builds, and organizing your code)
	‚Ä¢	minecraft-scripting-samples (official, tons of ready-made examples for scripting, AI, and more)

What to do:
	‚Ä¢	Use Blokkr to scaffold your project (‚Äúblok new my-zoo-addon‚Äù), or just clone the scripting-samples repo for a head start.
	‚Ä¢	These will give you all the folders and files you need, and lots of example code you can copy/paste or tweak.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Powerful Community Modules: JaylyDev ScriptAPI
	‚Ä¢	Go to JaylyDev/ScriptAPI (community-made add-ons and helpers)
	‚Ä¢	Find useful code for:
	‚Ä¢	Custom UI/menus
	‚Ä¢	Advanced player commands
	‚Ä¢	Permission systems (who‚Äôs staff, who‚Äôs visitor, etc.)

What to do:
	‚Ä¢	Copy the components or utilities you need into your project (the readme and folders explain what each does)
	‚Ä¢	Use these as examples or building blocks for your own features

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI & NPC Examples: Scripting and Tutorials
	‚Ä¢	Both Microsoft and JaylyDev repos have scripts for:
	‚Ä¢	Making NPCs walk around
	‚Ä¢	Making bots follow players
	‚Ä¢	Triggering behaviors on events (like interacting with an exhibit)
	‚Ä¢	You can also find simple YouTube/video tutorials like ‚ÄúHow to Make a Working Walking AI in Minecraft Bedrock with Commands‚Äù and ‚ÄúNPC Followers‚Äù for step-by-step walkthroughs.

What to do:
	‚Ä¢	Start by copying an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù script‚Äîlike a wandering or following NPC‚Äîand make it your own (change messages, paths, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Test it in your world; expand as you learn

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ GameTest & Automated Behavior
	‚Ä¢	Use minecraft-gametests to add testing and automation (e.g., NPCs that perform actions on a schedule, or run checks when certain things happen)
	‚Ä¢	This isn‚Äôt required for fun, but it‚Äôs handy if you want complex or automated behaviors

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Customize and Combine
	‚Ä¢	You control the world file:
Just import your zoo world into Minecraft.
	‚Ä¢	Add your custom behavior pack (the one you built using steps above)
	‚Ä¢	Mix and match code samples, modules, and AI scripts until it feels right

‚∏ª

üèóÔ∏è Plan / Workflow
	1.	Set up your project folder using Blokkr or by cloning Microsoft‚Äôs scripting-samples.
	2.	Browse through JaylyDev ScriptAPI and scripting-samples for code examples‚Äîcopy in features you want.
	3.	Choose a starter AI/NPC example (from samples or community tutorials) and put it in your project.
	4.	Test: Load into Minecraft Bedrock (on your tablet, Switch, etc.) and try it out!
	5.	Expand: Add more features, tweak NPC logic, experiment with permissions.
	6.	Ask for help: If you get stuck, both repos have communities, and you can always come back here for help.
